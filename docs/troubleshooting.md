# Troubleshooting

- `doctor` rejects WSL paths: move the checkout and state beneath the Linux home directory; `drvfs` and `9p` are unsupported for worktrees and locks.
- `resources already exist`: run reconciliation and inspect the exact attempt. Do not remove the directory/session manually.
- an attempt is blocked after restart: compare its GitHub marker, manifest base/head, branch, worktree HEAD, and tmux session; repair only when identity is exact.
- feedback remains pending: verify immutable feedback ID, actor authorization, PR head, claim/outcome record, and the next reconciliation result.
- merge remains gated: check current-head validation/docs evidence, actionable feedback, independent review, human-review-label removal by an authorized actor, required checks, approvals, branch currency, and protection.
- checksum verification fails: discard the artifact and regenerate from a clean source commit with the same version and `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`.
